## About
This back-end is built for this [ReactJS PWA](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/tagging-tracker-pwa) primarily used for auth(JWT), S3 upload and data syncing. The data sync eg. the address/tag-info/owner-info tables are held in `MySQL` and photos are stored in S3.

The structure is pretty basic, the `index.js` file detects if it is live/if that is the case it will deploy to `https` these certificate files need to exist. Ideally they would be automatically generated with certbot but currently the live site is using 1yr long basic domain validated certs.

### Routes
`/login-user`
`/upload-tag`
`/sync-up`
`/sync-down`

## Dependencies
* Node, MySQL, AWS S3 Bucket(optional -- up to you)

## Local Dev
You can use `npm run server` if you have `nodemon` installed to develop or just `node index.js`
You should have it installed as it's part of the dependencies

## Installation
Assuming you have node/npm installed, you should be able to install all the dependencies as they're in `package.json` through `npm install`. Then run the backend with `node index.js` or `nodemon server`

The backend for dev is hosted on `localhost:5000` this only matters because the PWA react app is mapped to it through the proxy in the PWA's `package.json`

## AWS S3
You will need the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`. The `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` go inside the credentials file(no extension)
These should be in your respective locations depending on platform(Windows or Linux):
* windows - `C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\credentials`
* linux - `~/.aws/credentials`

### credentials file structure:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

The node `aws-sdk` package will try to read/find that file. I just made that file from VS code, didn't even bother with the AWS CLI stuff.

## Node Auth
The PWA/Node is using `jsonwebtoken` for auth and storing it in a state variable on the ReactJS PWA.

Regarding safety of tokens, different opinions if holding token on localStorage or httpWebOnly token, cookie, etc... see links below for more info. The users are limited to their accounts so while they have full read/write access, they can only affect their own files.

## Deployment
You need to install `MySQL`, `MariaDB` was used on `Debian 10`. The node `mysql2` client is just that, it's not the server itself, so you have to install MySQL on your local dev environment/the remote server and create auth/set credentials to connect to `MySQL` from `Node` in a `.env` file. The user would either need full privileges or create the `tagging_tracker` database first and give that user read/write access to that database in order to run the `seed-database.js` file.

You will also need to run the private `createUser` function in `/utils/users` since there isn't a registration aspect to this app yet. You can just run `createUser('username','pass')` while running the node app locally.

### Table seeding
The `seed-database.js` file should run completely provided you have a working local/remote `MySQL` install with a user which as I mentioned has full privileges or you create the `tagging_tracker` database first then create/assign the user to have full access to that databse. Which you can then use that(put credentials in `.env` file) to run the `seed-database.js` file to make all the tables.

## Deploying with Systemd
One way to deploy the node back end is through [systemd](https://www.axllent.org/docs/view/nodejs-service-with-systemd/) a service manager in `Linux`, this takes the place of running the `node` app by `node index.js` directly in terminal. If you go this route, note that when you make changes you will have to reload the daemon i.e. `systemctl daemon-reload` and then restart the service i.e. `systemctl restart nameofservice.service`.

## Potential issues
`max_packet_size` this should be at least `100MB` just to pull a number out of thin air but a `ECONNRESET` issue appeared once while development due to a large file. The `100MB` is insane but [apparently](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/45665/what-max-allowed-packet-is-big-enough-and-why-do-i-need-to-change-it) it's fine with a max of `1GB`. It is important to keep in mind that a `base64` file grows significantly eg. an original `~4MB` file jumps to over `10MB` when converted to `base64`.

Check in `MYSQL CLI` with `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE `max_allowed_packet`;`
Update with `SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=value_in_bytes;`
Note: the variable shown by the `SHOW...` command will not change, I think because they're not the same e.g. `GLOBAL`. But if you were running into the `ECONNRESET` issue it's probably fixed now, try it. The other alternative is the connection being [terminated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22900931/mysql-giving-read-econnreset-error-after-idle-time-on-node-js-server/22906189#22906189) too early but I checked(in Windows 10) and it was set to the default of `28800`.
